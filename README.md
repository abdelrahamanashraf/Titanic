# Titanic
Its exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical modeling on the Titanic Dataset in order to gather insights and evenutally predicting survior(0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived). Out of the 891 passengers that went on board the titanic, approximately 38% of them got surived where as majority 62% did not survive the disaster


what i do in notebook : 

1- Import the relevant python libraies for the analysis
2- Load the train dataset and set the index if applicable
3- Visually inspect the head of the dataset,Examine the train dataset to understand in particular if the data is tidy,examine missing values
4-Run discriptive statistics of object and numerical datatypes, and finally transform datatypes accordingly
5- Preprocessing and Prepare data for statistical modeling





I Used libraries like Numpy for math ,Pandas for along an axis of the DataFrame , matplotlib for creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels and Finally seaborn for making statistical graphics in Python

Requirements : python7.3
